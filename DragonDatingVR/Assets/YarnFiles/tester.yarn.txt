Ike: What the heck? You’re still out here?!
You: Uh…?
Ike: We threw a ripper last night. You took a shot from Brad’s running shoe.
You smack your lips together and caught on the back of your tongue is the taste of a black athletic sock.
You: Disgusting.
Ike: 
Ike: Yeah. It really was. Anyways, it’s 3:00PM and time for band practice.
You: It’s already 3:00PM??? Oh my god, Laura is going to falcon punch me into another dimension.
You check your phone. You have seven unread text messages. One unheard voice message.
Text Message: I’m here!... Thirty minutes early. Sorry.
Text Message: I’ve been pacing outside your door for exactly six minutes and forty nine seconds.
Text Message: I could have plucked out every single one of my eyebrow hairs by now.
Text Message: What even is eyebrow hair???
Text Message: If you were here you would be able to come up with some crazy definition.
Text Message: We were supposed to STUDY. Studying is a sacred act.
Text Message: I’m starting to worry. Don’t make me call the town police, the state police, the federal government AND your Mom.
Voice Message: Hey. I know that I sent you an actual barrage of text messages. I just took my blood pressure with my mobile pump and it’s very high. I better go home and practice the breathing exercises that my therapist taught me. I hope you’re okay and that you didn’t ditch me.
You: Wow, I went from not feeling guilty to feeling guilty very quickly.
Ike: Sit down at that keyboard and press some keys to make pretty noises, you nerd.

You sit down in a green, plastic lawn chair in front of an electric keyboard. 
The soft, dim glow of the lights on the top panel are familiar to you. The middle C key is well worn from hours of practice.
Ike: Alright, let’s jam on that new riff you’ve been working on. What do you think you’re gunna call it?
You: How about… “Boy Insides/ Girl Insides/ Insides.”
Ike: I’m into it. Kick it off, loser.

You: Hey! I’m so sorry about earlier.
<<if $girl is true>>
	Laura: You are literally unforgiven. I spent all day wondering, “Where is he? What basement is he curled in with a scar above the spot where his kidneys should be?”
	You feel a pang of dread deep in your stomach and it makes you feel sick. Laura just called you a boy. You feel like you could rip every single scale off of your body. When will you be able to be transparent?

Laura: Well, maybe we can just meet up tomorrow to go over our notes.
You: Don’t you mean your notes?
Laura: You are hopeless.
You: I know.
